# Hello, I'm Kauan! 🧑🏻💻

**Full-Stack Developer 🐘** with expertise in web system architecture and technical leadership. In the agency where I work, I am responsible for all technological decision-making — from selecting the ideal tech stack to delivery, scheduling, full-stack development, and team coordination.

My experience includes **complete project architecture**: I choose technologies (Laravel/React.js/Vue.js for robust applications, Bootstrap, Vanilla JavaScript, PHP WordPress for agile solutions), set realistic deadlines, build RESTful APIs, implement optimized databases, and orchestrate deployments in cloud environments. I transform complex requirements into scalable systems, always prioritizing performance, security, and proven coding practices.
